# NENA Repository Policy Project v21.0a
## NENA Interface Specification Working Group
### NENA Data Structures Committee
_Sign up at https://nena.org/page/VolunteerInterest_

This workgroup will write a policy for contributing and managing code repositories for various NENA deliverables. The workgroup will write two versions of an administrative policy that:

* Deliverable 1
  * Sets rules overall for NENA repositories
  * Sets a policy for creating a new repository
  * Sets a policy for updating the repository (e.g., NENA Document Required, Expert Review, Specification Required, First Come First Serve, etc)
  * Sets a policy for managing a repository
  * Sets a policy maintaining API definitions and schemas in a repository 
* Deliverable 2
  * Sets rules for maintaining registries in a repository
  * Sets rules for maintaining a NENA master glossary in a repository
  * Sets guidelines for using code repositories for document version control
  * Sets technical rules for maintaining online NENA Master Glossary entries

It is expected that this work will incorporate significant portions of IETF RFC 8874 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8874). 

This workgroup will pilot document version control using a code repository and will write initial drafts of documents in markdown. The workgroup will meet infrequently, such as monthly or quarterly. In lieu of attending frequent (e.g., weekly) meetings, participation in group mailing lists is REQUIRED as a condition of membership in this workgroup.

This is a work in progress and may contain errors and may never be published.
